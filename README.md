## Full Pipeline Walkthrough

### Step 1 — Read Video

`utils/video_utils.py · read_video()`

OpenCV reads every frame into a list of NumPy arrays (`BGR`, `H × W × 3`). All downstream modules receive this list; the original frames are never mutated until the final visualisation pass.

---

### Step 2 — Detection & Tracking

`trackers/tracker.py · Tracker.get_object_tracks()`

**Detection** — YOLOv8 runs inference in batches of 20 frames. Goalkeepers are re-mapped to the `player` class before tracking so they receive stable player IDs.

**Tracking** — ByteTrack matches detections across frames using a Kalman filter + IoU-based assignment, producing a persistent integer `track_id` for each object.

**Output structure:**
```python
tracks = {
    "players":  [ {track_id: {"bbox": [x1,y1,x2,y2], "track_id": int}, ...}, ... ],  # one dict per frame
    "referees": [ {track_id: {"bbox": ...}, ...}, ... ],
    "balls":    [ {track_id: {"bbox": ...}, ...}, ... ],
}
```

Results are pickled to `runs/backups/tracks.pkl` so re-runs skip inference entirely (`read_backup=True`).

---

### Step 3 — Ball Position Interpolation

`trackers/tracker.py · Tracker.interpolate_ball_positions()`

The ball detector occasionally misses frames (occlusion, motion blur). Linear interpolation fills every gap **between** real detections:

- All four bbox coordinates (`x1, y1, x2, y2`) are interpolated independently so ball size is preserved.
- Frames before the first detection and after the last detection are **left empty** — the ball is not frozen at a stale position.
- Interpolated frames carry an `"interpolated": True` flag for downstream awareness.

```
Frame:    0    1    2   [3]   4    5    6   [7]   8    9
Detected: —    —    —    ✓    —    —    —    ✓    —    —
Filled:   —    —    —    ✓   fill fill fill   ✓    —    —
```

---

### Step 4 — Camera Movement Estimation & Compensation

`camera_movement/camera_movement.py · CameraMovement`

Broadcast cameras pan and tilt continuously. Raw pixel positions therefore conflate player movement with camera movement.

**Estimation:**
1. Shi-Tomasi corner features are detected in a top-strip ROI (the scoreboard area, which is static relative to the camera).
2. Lucas–Kanade optical flow tracks these features frame-to-frame.
3. The feature with the largest displacement is taken as `(cx, cy)` — the camera's translation vector for that frame.
4. If displacement exceeds a threshold the feature set is re-initialised from the new frame.

**Compensation** (`apply_camera_compensation`):
Every object's centre position is adjusted:
```python
adjusted_position = (cx_pixel - camera_dx, cy_pixel - camera_dy)
```
This `adjusted_position` is used by all metric calculations downstream.

---

### Step 5 — Team Assignment

`team_assigners/team_assigner.py · TeamAssigner`

1. **Colour extraction** — the upper half of each player's bounding box is cropped and 2-cluster K-Means separates jersey (foreground, brighter) from pitch/background pixels.
2. **Team clustering** — on the first frame all extracted colours are clustered into two groups; cluster centres become `team_colors[1]` and `team_colors[2]` (BGR tuples).
3. **Per-player prediction** — subsequent frames predict each new player's team from their jersey colour using the stored K-Means model. Results are cached by `track_id`.
4. **Refresh** — the cache is invalidated every `refresh_interval` frames to handle kit-change or lighting drift.
5. **Goalkeeper override** — specific `track_id` values can be hard-coded to a team to correct misclassifications.

---

### Step 6 — Ball Possession Assignment

`ball_assigners/ball_assigner.py · BallAssigner`
`trackers/tracker.py · Tracker.update_ball_possession()`

For each frame:
1. The ball's centre is computed from its bbox.
2. Euclidean distance is measured from the ball centre to every player's foot anchor.
3. The closest player within `max_distance` pixels is declared the ball carrier (`has_ball = True`).
4. All teammates of the ball carrier receive `team_has_ball = True`.
5. Possession frames are accumulated in `team_possession_frames` for the HUD percentage.

---

### Step 7 — Perspective Transformation

`perspective_transformer/perspective_transformer.py · PerspectiveTransformer`

Four manually-defined pixel coordinates mark the four corners of the visible pitch area. `cv2.getPerspectiveTransform` computes a homography **H** that maps image space → world space (metres):

```
Image corners (pixels)  →  World corners (metres)
[110, 1035]  →  [0,  68]   bottom-left
[265,  275]  →  [0,   0]   top-left
[910,  260]  →  [23.32, 0] top-right
[1640, 915]  →  [23.32,68] bottom-right
```

Each player's `adjusted_position` is transformed; points outside the pitch polygon return `None`.

---

### Step 8 — Speed & Distance

`speed_and_distance/speed_and_distance.py · SpeedAndDistance`

Over a sliding window of 5 frames:
```
distance (m) = Euclidean( world_pos[t], world_pos[t+5] )
time (s)     = 5 frames / 24 fps
speed (km/h) = (distance / time) × 3.6
```
Cumulative distance is tracked per player. Both values are written back into the `tracks` dict and drawn as text overlays below each player's bounding box.

---

### Step 9 — Visualisation

`utils/draw_utils.py` · `trackers/tracker.py · Tracker.visualize_tracks()`

Three rendering passes produce the final annotated frames:

| Pass | Function | What is drawn |
|---|---|---|
| `visualize_tracks` | draw_utils | Ground ellipses, ID badges, ball rings, possession arrows, team halos, possession HUD bar |
| `draw_camera_movement` | CameraMovement | Camera dx/dy readout overlay |
| `draw_speed_and_distance` | SpeedAndDistance | Speed (km/h) and distance (m) text per player |

**Visual elements:**

- **Player shadow disc** — perspective-aware ground ellipse filled with team colour; glow bloom layers for depth.
- **ID badge** — pill-shaped label centred on the ellipse, tinted to team colour.
- **Ball** — concentric glowing red rings with translucent fill and specular shine arc.
- **Ball-carrier marker** — red downward-pointing chevron above the player's head with drop shadow.
- **Team possession halo** — dashed red ring around foot ellipses of all teammates of the ball carrier.
- **Possession HUD** — bottom-centre pill bar split by team colour with live percentage labels.

---

### Step 10 — Save Output

`utils/video_utils.py · save_video()`

OpenCV `VideoWriter` (codec `mp4v`, 30 fps) writes the annotated frame list to the output path. The output directory is created automatically.

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdelrahmanSaadIdress/Football-Analysis-System_.git
cd Football-Analysis-System_

pip install ultralytics supervision scikit-learn opencv-python numpy
```

> Python 3.8 or newer is required. A CUDA-capable GPU is strongly recommended for real-time inference speeds.

---

## Model Weights

The fine-tuned YOLOv8 model is hosted on Kaggle:

> **[⬇ Download `best.pt` from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/models/abdelrhmansaadidrees/football-match-analysis-system)**

After downloading, place the file at:

```
Football-Analysis-System_/
└── yolo_models/
    └── best.pt          ← put it here
```

Or pass a custom path at runtime with `--model_path`.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Download model weights (see above) and place in yolo_models/best.pt

# 2. Put your input video at the default path
cp your_match.mp4 video_samples/08fd33_4.mp4

# 3. Run the pipeline
python main.py

# Output is written to:
#   runs/outputs/result.mp4
```

**Custom paths:**

```bash
python main.py \
  --model_path  yolo_models/best.pt \
  --output_path runs/outputs/my_match.mp4
```

> On the first run, tracks are computed and cached to `runs/backups/tracks.pkl`.  
> Subsequent runs load the cache instantly — delete the file to force re-detection.
